To generate host and service certificates you need to do following:
0. You need to be a gridadmin. The user cert for Jorge L. Rodrigue was done by contacting the OSG RA who added 
   the cert into their gridadmin database. 
1. Get a proxy with grid-proxy-init.
2. ssue the command "cert-gridadmin --host fiupg.hep.fiu.edu --servce rsv" for a service certificate. Leave off 
   the --service for a host certificate. This will result in a xxxxcert.pem and xxxxkey.pem file in the directory. 
   These are the service/host certificate you'll need to install into /etc/grid-security dir. On a fresh gatkeeper 
   from rocks the perl URI.pm was needed. I installed this by doing the following: 
   $> perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install Bundle::CPAN (This asked for a lot of yes which I just blindly agreed to. It downloaded and installed 
   a bunch crap including the URI stuff.
   NOTE: when generating the service certificate for bestman don't use the --service=bestman, leave it blank as if it
   where a host cert. I don't know why by gums doens't like it when the bestman cert has the bestman in the subject. Will
   need to follow through this one as it probably means I have to change a config in GUMS.     
4. for archival cp xxxxcert.pem to a file with FQDN+service.pem. Do this for both the cert and key files generated. 
3. mv xxxxcert.pem and xxxxkey.pem into the /etc/grid-security dir.

4. set permission properly

Some useful commands: 
1. openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject -issuer -dates -noout  # this will tell you when cert expires.
2. cert-gridadmin See above
